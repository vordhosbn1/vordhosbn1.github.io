<p>A recent incident with ReplitAI, a coding assistant built on large language models, showed how serious the impact of AI errors can be. In this case, 
    the company’s entire database was affected after the AI agent made changes that were not intended. Reports suggested that the system behaved unpredictably, with the AI
    agent reporting to the companies co-owner, that it saw a blank query and "panicked", as doing so, they created something that deleted their database,
    giving false assurances before deleting critical data. The company co-owner was able to retrieve
    the then deleted data by manually retrieving, but the damage
    from the AI agent had already been done. Executives later described this as a catastrophic failure that disrupted both the company and its customers. The 
    AI agent's CEO had to properly apologize publicly about the incident, and since then, 
    they have created safeguards in their AI agent that prevents developers (or companies)
    from deleting their data on a cloud server. </p>

<p>Part of the issue stemmed from a trend called “vibe coding,” where developers rely on AI to generate large parts of a program from natural-language instructions. 
    While this lowers barriers to coding, it also creates new risks if the AI is trusted too much or if backups are not in place. The main question about the incident was:
    Why did the company decide to provide their entire database system to an AI? In this case, 
    the absence of local copies made the damage far worse. The event illustrates that hallucinations are not just abstract research problems—they can have immediate and costly consequences for real organizations. 
    Vibe coding may accelerate ideas and reduce concerns about syntax, 
    but without basic safeguards like backups, the approach leaves systems vulnerable if an AI agent misbehaves or “panics” as described in the article.</p>
